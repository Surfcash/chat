# CHAT CONFIGURATION
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Everything below this line is part of the chat configuration.
# If you are using a non-LOCAL configuration service in your
# Monolith configuration you have to copy paste this to your
# configuration file storage in a file with name identical to
# the 'configurationFileName' as configured above. This file
# name should be the relative path from the root of your file
# storage as configured in the Monolith configuration.
#
# Even if you are using a non-LOCAL configuration service this
# local configuration file has to be present for the plugin to
# read the name of the file it should ask Monolith for.
#
# If you are using a LOCAL configuration service you can ignore
# the 'configurationFileName' setting. The plugin will use what
# is configured in this file instead.

# LOGGING
# Options: [CONSOLE, NOOP]
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# If CONSOLE all messages in all channels will be printed to
# the console (in an unformatted form to improve readability).
# If NOOP (No Operation) no messages will be logged.
# The option to log to cloud services is on the to-do list,
# but low priority. If you need an alternative implementation
# right now please consider opening a pull request.
